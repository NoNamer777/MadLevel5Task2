# MAD - Level 5: Task 2

This Mobile Application is developed as part of the introduction to the Mobile Application Development at HvA.
The application is used to improve the application architecture by using ViewModels.

The user should be able to navigate between 2 fragment: the backlog and the game addition form.
The user should then be able to add a game to the backlog, by providing a title, what platform he wishes to play on and the release date of the game.

Those values are checked before the game is stored in the on device database.

Then the user can either remove a single game, or clear the complete backlog when he'd like to.
